# E-Commerce sales dashboard
I recently created this E‑Commerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze sales performance, customer trends, and profitability across regions and categories.

The dataset consisted of two tables — Orders and Order Details — which were transformed and modeled to build meaningful visual insights for decision‑making.

### Key Insights
Overall Business Performance
- Total Sales: 438K
- Total Quantity Sold: 5615 units
- Average Order Value (AOV): 121K
- Total Profit: 37K
These metrics provide a strong snapshot of e‑commerce performance across multiple regions.

### Sales by Category
Clothing dominates with 63% of total sales, indicating strong demand and possibly effective marketing or seasonal appeal.
Electronics (21%) and Furniture (17%) follow, suggesting potential growth areas for diversification or promotional focus.

### Payment Method Analysis
Cash on Delivery (COD) remains the most popular at 44%, followed by UPI (21%).
This indicates a partial dependence on COD, highlighting an opportunity to encourage digital payments through discounts or loyalty points.
Profit by Month
The highest profit was observed in December, likely due to festive or holiday season sales.
Losses in May and June suggest lower demand or higher operational costs — a potential area for strategic review.

### Top Customers
Customers Harivansh and Madhav contribute the highest sales, showing a strong high‑value customer base.
Loyalty programs or premium offers could help retain such key customers.

### Sales by State
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh lead in total sales.
Expanding distribution or marketing in Delhi and Rajasthan could improve overall reach and balance regional performance.

### Profit by Sub‑Category
Printers and Bookcases are the most profitable sub‑categories.

Focused inventory management and marketing could enhance revenue from these high-margin items.

#### Takeaway
This dashboard demonstrates how data visualization transforms raw data into actionable insights. Building it helped me strengthen my skills in:
Power BI (data modeling, DAX, and visualization),
Data analysis and storytelling, and
Business performance optimization through data-driven insights.

I’m continuously working on improving my analytical and visualization skills, and I’d love to connect with other data professionals and gain feedback on this project!
